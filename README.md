# Master-Thesis-OCT
# The experimental part of this work consists of a proof of concept focused on one of the techniques,
# the Optical Coherence Tomography. This test has the objective of knowing the possibilities of
# automatization of the OCT technique for detecting failures in the heat sealing of plastic containers
# in the meat industry, one of the applications demanded nowadays.

# In turn, it is part of a research project for one of Tecnalia's clients. For its realization,
# it has the support of two optical coherence tomography systems, one within the Photonics Group
# of the University of Cantabria and the other within the Tecnalia Artificial Vision Group.
# The data collected in the measurements will be processed by Python software, creating an algorithm
# that allows to quickly identify poorly sealed areas according to established parameters.
